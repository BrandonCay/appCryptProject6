Google Attempt
-Contains the same results from first project4RSA submission
-Possible solution avenues from last report apply
-An additional solution path is to apply the "solution
avenue" that I specified in my example docs
-Result was fail

Example.com  Attempt
-Used new methods to store file results inside textFiles
-Result was a failure
-One solution avenue:
--use openssl to verify certificate. If it doesn't succeed
then data is wrong. If date is wrong, then I retrace my steps
(at the moment, not too sure what could've slipped). If openssl
succeeds given the data present here, then my code is wrong. If
my code is wrong, I should fix it.
-Oddly, example.com had 3 certificates. The example shown
suggested it should have the same results as example.org.
Perhaps example.com updated or the example cut off the
third certificate
